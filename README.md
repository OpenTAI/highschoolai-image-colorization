## High School AI - Image Colorization

This a toy project to explain to high school students how to use AI to help find lost children. One way is image colorization, which can convert old photos into modern style such that it can be searched and compared in the image database to find a more accurate match. The code is adapted from an existing Github Repo for educational purposes.
